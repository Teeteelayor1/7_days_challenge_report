### 1. BASICS OF CYBERSECURITY
The CIA triad is a framework that combines three key information security principles: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
The CIA triad provides a simple and complete checklist for evaluating an organization's security. An effective IT security system consists of the CIA triad provides a high-level framework for cybersecurity professionals to consider when auditing, implementing, and improving systems, tools, and programs for organizations. It is a powerful way to identify weak points and form solutions to strengthen policies and programs. confidentiality, integrity, and availability,

### CONFIDENTIALITY
Confidentiality involves keeping sensitive data private and safe from unauthorized access. This includes protecting information from bad actors with malicious intent, as well as limiting access to only authorized individuals within an organization.

### INTEGRITY
Maintaining data integrity is important to make sure data and business analysts are accessing accurate information. Data shown to the public must also maintain integrity so that customers can trust the organization. A system with integrity keeps data safe from unnecessary changes, whether malicious or accidental. Cybersecurity professionals might implement access levels, enable tracking when making changes, and protect data when transferring or storing it.

### AVAILABILITY
Availability refers to the idea that the people who need access to data can get itâ€”without affecting its confidentiality or integrity. 

### 2. CYBER THREATS
Phishing is the practice of sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a legitimate and reputable source, usually through email and text messaging. The attacker's goal is to steal money, gain access to sensitive data and login information, or to install malware on the victim's device.

Malware, short for malicious software, refers to any intrusive software developed by cybercriminals (often called hackers) to steal data and damage or destroy computers and computer systems. Examples of common malware include viruses, worms, Trojan viruses, spyware, and adware

Ransomware is a type of malware which prevents you from accessing your device and the data stored on it, usually by encrypting your files. A criminal group will then demand a ransom in exchange for decryption. The computer itself may become locked, or the data on it might be encrypted, stolen or deleted.
